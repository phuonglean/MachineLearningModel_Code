# MachineLearningModel_Code
Standard code for Machine Learning models and will be updated every new model I have learned on Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

Last Updated Date: 30.12.2023

I have completed Supervised Learning and Advanced Learning algorithms courses which cover:
1. Linear Regression (with Gradient Descent, Cost function computation, Feature Scaling, SGDRegression)
2. Logistic Regression (Batch Gradient Descent, Cost function computation)
